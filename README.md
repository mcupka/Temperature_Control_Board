Temperature Control Board

This is a control board for a toaster oven reflow project. It will use the following major parts:

- ESP32 module for processing (wifi / bluetooth maybe?)
- MAX31855 to interface with the thermocouple
- SD Card interface
- I2C interface for OLED display
- UART for debug / programming (microusb?)
- Extra IOs and interfaces available for future uses of this board
